# Logbook
Starting 2024.3.19, I will write down a kind of daily "standup" for what I hope to accomplish when I sit down to code, and then later write what I actually got done.

### March 19
Today, my goal is to complete most of the refactoring from the original, messy codebase, into something more object oriented and easier to understand. I expect this will take up most of my time, but if it does not, I will finish testing of the molecular permutation prediction task.
