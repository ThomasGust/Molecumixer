# Logbook
Starting 2024.3.19, I will write down a kind of daily "standup" for what I hope to accomplish when I sit down to code, and then later write what I actually got done.

## March
### March 19
Today, my goal is to complete most of the refactoring from the original, messy codebase, into something more object oriented and easier to understand. I expect this will take up most of my time, but if it does not, I will finish testing of the molecular permutation prediction task.

I made some good progress on the refactor, there was a firedrill at the end of my work block so I didn't finish up the refactor, but it is getting close, I will finish that soon.

### March 21
Today I will try to complete the refactoring of the code. I will also try to start writing some unit tests because of the rapidly increasing size of this codebase. If I do not finish the refactor today, I will set aside some time to fully knock it out on the weekend so I can get back to the fun stuff.
